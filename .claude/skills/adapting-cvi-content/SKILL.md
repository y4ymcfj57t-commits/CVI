name: adapting-cvi-content
description: Adapts classroom materials (worksheets, slides, textbooks, assessments, diagrams, board notes, graphic organizers) for students with CVI (Cortical/Cerebral Visual Impairment). Use when modifying educational content for visual processing difficulties including clutter sensitivity, crowding issues, visual search challenges, latency needs, field preferences, or fatigue. Supports all CVI Range phases (I/II/III) and processing profiles (dorsal, ventral, lower-level, higher-VFD, mixed CVI+ocular). Triggers: CVI, cerebral visual impairment, cortical visual impairment, visual complexity, clutter, crowding, visual search, latency, field preference, dorsal stream, ventral stream, visual fatigue.

# Adapting Classroom Content for CVI

Adapt classroom content for students with Cortical/Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI). CVI is brain-based visual processing dysfunction, so adaptations must match both **(a) severity** and **(b) type of visual processing difficulty**.

## Procedure

### 1. Collect Access Information

Gather minimum information needed to adapt the content.

**Student access profile:**
- CVI Range Phase (I / II / III) if known; otherwise ask for observable behaviors
- Processing profile if known: dorsal-leaning, ventral-leaning, lower-level (acuity/fields), higher visual function deficits, or mixed CVI+ocular
- Micro-characteristics: visual complexity sensitivity, field preference, latency, movement need, light sensitivity/attraction, distance viewing difficulty, fatigue/variability

**Content context:**
- Grade/subject and learning goal (do not reduce rigor)
- Content type: worksheet/handout, slide deck, textbook page, graphic organizer, diagram, assessment, board notes
- Delivery: print, projected, digital (tablet/laptop), or mixed
- Environment: quiet corner vs busy room; time constraints; whether support staff is present

### 2. Select Severity Lens

| Phase | Functional Level | Core Approach |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| I | Most severe impact | "Turn vision on" with minimal complexity; single targets; short bursts |
| II | Building purposeful use | Introduce complexity gradually; teach visual search; organized layouts |
| III | Real-world complexity challenges | Support search/clutter/fatigue; teach compensations; self-advocacy |

**For detailed phase-specific guidance:**
- [Phase I Adaptations](references/phase1-adaptations.md) - single targets, attention on-ramps, latency, short trials, tactile/audio pairing
- [Phase II Adaptations](references/phase2-adaptations.md) - complexity ladder, organized layouts, explicit search instruction, anchors
- [Phase III Adaptations](references/phase3-adaptations.md) - clutter reduction, digital affordances, compensation strategies, fatigue management

### 3. Select Profile Lens

| Profile | Primary Challenges | Key Adaptations |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Dorsal | Search, clutter, motion, busy places | Reduce arrays, add visual anchors, teach explicit scanning |
| Ventral | Recognition (faces, objects, symbols) | Consistent icons/fonts, pair with labels, use real objects/photos first |
| Lower-level | Acuity, visual fields, glare | Size enlargement, high contrast, field positioning, glare control |
| Higher-VFD | Struggles despite "good acuity" | Clean design, fatigue supports, reduce simultaneous demands |
| Mixed | CVI + ocular conditions | Combine low-vision supports AND CVI complexity/latency controls |

**For the complete profile-to-adaptations matrix:** [Profile Adaptations Matrix](references/profile-adaptations-matrix.md)

### 4. Generate Adaptation Plan

Build a three-tier plan:

**Tier 1: Universal changes** (apply to virtually all students with CVI)
- Reduce clutter/crowding; increase spacing; remove non-essential decoration
- Provide one direction at a time
- Add wait time (latency)
- Use predictable layout and consistent visual language

**Tier 2: Targeted changes** (based on Phase + Profile)
- Load appropriate phase reference file from `references/`
- Apply profile-specific adaptations from the matrix
- Honor field preferences and micro-characteristics

**Tier 3: Compensations and instruction**
- Teach strategies ("look-locate-confirm")
- Add multimodal access: tactile, audio, verbal mediation
- Provide checklists for multi-step tasks
- Teach self-advocacy scripts

### 5. Produce Outputs

Generate appropriate deliverables:

| Output | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Student-ready version** | Adapted material (print or digital) the student will use |
| **Teacher-facing instructions** | How to present, wait time, environment setup, what to observe |
| **Fidelity checklist** | Verification that required adaptations were applied |

**For output format templates:** [Output Templates](references/output-templates.md)

### 6. Validate and Iterate

- Request feedback: "What part still feels visually hard?"
- Change ONE variable at a time (spacing, contrast, array size, background, distance)
- Document what works for future reference
- If student distress increases, stop and reduce sensory load

## Quick Examples

### Phase I: Counting Worksheet
**Original:** Crowded worksheet with 12 problems, small clipart objects
**Adapted:** 1-2 problems per page, large simple shapes, plain background, teacher presents and waits, touch confirmation allowed

### Phase III + Dorsal: Reading Comprehension
**Original:** Dense passage with sidebar content, multiple-choice on same page
**Adapted:** Remove sidebars, increase line spacing, chunk paragraphs, questions on separate pages, teach "find it" routine (locate paragraph number, then sentence)

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Unknown Phase/Profile | Default to reduce complexity + add latency + consistent layout; observe what helps; then refine |
| Student has "good acuity" but struggles | Treat as higher visual function deficits - clean design and fatigue supports |
| Mixed CVI + ocular condition | Apply BOTH size/contrast/glare controls AND CVI complexity/latency controls |
| Teacher insists on original format | Offer compromise: masking strip, fewer visible items, digital zoom, separate question pages |
| No CVI documentation available | Collect observable behaviors; apply conservative adaptations; note assumptions |
| Student does well at near but not far | Provide near copy of board content; reduce reliance on copying from distance |
| Complexity increase causes regression | Step back one level on the complexity ladder; maintain longer before trying again |
| Student struggles mainly in cafeteria/assemblies | Prioritize portable supports (visual schedule, verbal preview, quieter seating) even if paper materials are fine |

## Boundaries

- **Do NOT diagnose CVI** - Adapt based on documented plan or observed behaviors only
- **Do NOT lower academic expectations** - Preserve learning goal and content rigor
- **Do NOT overload with accommodations** - Change one variable at a time to identify what works
- **Do NOT withdraw supports based on appearance** - "Looking fine" does not mean supports are unnecessary
- **Do NOT add visual "help" that increases clutter** - Excess highlighting or icons can make things worse
- If student distress increases, **stop immediately**, reduce sensory load, and recommend team review (TVI/OT/SLP)
