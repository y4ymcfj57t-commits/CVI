## Dorsal-Leaning (Search/Clutter/Motion)

**Underlying challenge:** Difficulty processing "where" information - locating items in space, filtering visual clutter, processing motion, navigating busy environments.

### Characteristics
- Struggles to find items in arrays or on cluttered pages
- Overwhelmed in busy visual environments (cafeteria, hallways, crowded classrooms)
- Difficulty with visual search tasks (finding word on page, locating item on shelf)
- May have trouble with moving targets or motion-heavy content
- Spatial relationships may be challenging
- Often loses place when reading or scanning

### Adaptation Strategies

| Category | Specific Actions |
|----------|------------------|
| **Arrays** | Reduce number of items visible at once; start with 3-5 items maximum; use masking to limit visible content |
| **Spacing** | Increase whitespace between all elements; double or triple standard spacing; avoid crowding |
| **Anchors** | Add visual anchor points: boxes around items, borders, starting dots, arrows, numbered sequences |
| **Scanning** | Teach explicit scan routine: left-to-right, top-to-bottom, systematic pattern |
| **Search support** | Provide "find it" routines with specific steps; give location cues ("top right," "third row") |
| **Environment** | Reduce competing visual and auditory input during visual tasks; quiet workspace |
| **Motion** | Minimize moving elements; use static materials; avoid animations in digital content |
| **Backgrounds** | Plain backgrounds preferred; avoid patterned or photographic backgrounds |

### Example: Multiple-Choice Test (Dorsal Profile)

**Original:** 20 questions per page, 4 answer choices each, dense layout

**Adapted:**
- 4-5 questions per page maximum
- Each question in distinct box with clear borders
- Masking strip to reveal one question at a time
- Clear numbering as anchor points
- Increased spacing between answer choices
- Teach routine: "Find number -> Read question -> Read each choice A, B, C, D -> Mark answer -> Move strip"

---

## Ventral-Leaning (Recognition)

**Underlying challenge:** Difficulty processing "what" information - identifying objects, faces, symbols, distinguishing between similar items.

### Characteristics
- Difficulty recognizing faces (may not recognize familiar people out of context)
- Struggles to identify objects, especially when similar to others
- Trouble with symbols, icons, and abstract representations
- May confuse similar-looking letters, numbers, or words
- Difficulty identifying salient features that distinguish items
- May recognize items by context clues rather than visual features

### Adaptation Strategies

| Category | Specific Actions |
|----------|------------------|
| **Consistency** | Use identical icons, fonts, and visual elements across ALL materials; never change visual language mid-unit |
| **Labels** | Pair ALL symbols and icons with text labels; do not rely on symbol recognition alone |
| **Concrete to abstract** | Use real objects before photos; photos before drawings; drawings before symbols |
| **Feature teaching** | Explicitly teach distinguishing features: "The letter 'b' has the bump on the right" |
| **Face supports** | Provide name labels near faces in photos; use seating charts; verbal identification |
| **Distinctiveness** | Increase visual difference between similar items; avoid easily confused symbols |
| **Context** | Maintain consistent context for recognition; prepare student for out-of-context encounters |

### Example: Science Worksheet with Symbols (Ventral Profile)

**Original:** Worksheet uses various diagram symbols (atoms, molecules, arrows, process icons) without labels

**Adapted:**
- Create consistent symbol key that appears on EVERY page
- Add text label below or beside each symbol
- Use color-coding consistently (same color always = same element)
- For initial learning, use photos of actual models before diagrams
- Avoid introducing new symbols without explicit teaching
- Teach recognition by features: "The oxygen symbol is the red circle; hydrogen is the smaller white circle"

---

## Lower-Level (Acuity/Fields/Contrast)

**Underlying challenge:** Reduced basic visual function - difficulty seeing small things, low contrast items, peripheral areas, or managing glare.

### Characteristics
- Needs larger print or images than peers
- Difficulty with low-contrast materials (light gray text, pastel colors)
- May have restricted visual fields (sees only certain areas)
- Sensitive to glare from glossy paper, screens, or lighting
- Difficulty seeing at distance (board, projections)
- May need specific positioning of materials

### Adaptation Strategies

| Category | Specific Actions |
|----------|------------------|
| **Size** | Enlarge text and images to functional threshold (based on assessment); typically 16-24pt minimum |
| **Contrast** | High contrast always: black on white or white on black; avoid pastels, grays, low-contrast combinations |
| **Fields** | Position all materials within functional visual field; know where student sees best |
| **Glare** | Use matte paper finishes; indirect lighting; screen filters; avoid glossy materials |
| **Distance** | Provide near copies of all far content; reduce or eliminate board copying; allow closer seating |
| **Color** | Bold, saturated colors; avoid subtle color distinctions for important information |
| **Lighting** | Optimize lighting for student; may need brighter or dimmer; consistent and indirect preferred |

### Example: Textbook Page (Lower-Level Profile)

**Original:** Standard textbook with 10pt font, glossy pages, color photographs, content in margins

**Adapted:**
- Enlarge to 18pt font minimum (adjust based on functional vision assessment)
- Reformat for high contrast: black text on white matte paper
- Position in student's functional visual field (know which area they see best)
- Provide personal copy of any board content
- Use matte finish paper or matte overlay on glossy pages
- Move margin content to main text area or separate page
- Ensure adequate, non-glare lighting on workspace

## Higher Visual Function Deficits

**Underlying challenge:** Complex visual processing difficulty despite normal or near-normal acuity testing. Often unrecognized because student "looks fine" and passes basic vision screening.

### Characteristics
- Normal or near-normal acuity on eye chart
- Struggles with complex visual tasks that seem simple to others
- Significant visual fatigue, especially with extended or complex visual work
- Difficulty with simultaneous visual processing (multiple elements at once)
- May perform well in controlled settings but struggle in real-world complexity
- Performance highly variable based on fatigue, complexity, environment
- Often told "you're not trying" or "you can see fine"

### Adaptation Strategies

| Category | Specific Actions |
|----------|------------------|
| **Clean design** | Minimal, uncluttered layouts even though "acuity is fine"; this is the key accommodation |
| **Fatigue management** | Short visual task blocks (10-15 min); mandatory breaks; schedule visual work strategically |
| **Simultaneous reduction** | Present one component at a time; avoid multi-part visual displays |
| **Duration limits** | Track time on visual tasks; build in stopping points |
| **Support maintenance** | Continue accommodations despite apparent visual competence; do not fade based on appearance |
| **Validation** | Acknowledge that struggles are real despite normal testing; student is not "faking" |
| **Self-advocacy** | Teach scripts for explaining needs; student may face skepticism |

### Example: Multi-Step Science Lab (Higher-VFD Profile)

**Original:** Lab sheet with diagram, procedure steps, data table, and analysis questions all on front and back of one page

**Adapted:**
- Reformat as multi-page document: diagram on page 1, steps on page 2, data table on page 3, questions on page 4
- Clean layout on each page with generous whitespace
- Allow student to work through one page at a time
- Provide verbal review of each section before student begins it
- Schedule lab for earlier in day if possible
- Build in brief break between procedure and analysis
- Do not require copying from board during lab; provide pre-printed content

## Mixed CVI + Ocular

**Underlying challenge:** Student has BOTH brain-based visual processing differences (CVI) AND a diagnosed eye condition (examples: nystagmus, optic nerve hypoplasia, cataracts, strabismus, retinopathy of prematurity).

### Characteristics
- Documented eye condition requiring traditional low-vision accommodations
- ALSO shows CVI characteristics (complexity sensitivity, latency, fatigue, processing difficulties)
- May have had eye condition addressed without recognizing CVI component
- Needs both sets of accommodations simultaneously

### Adaptation Strategies

Apply BOTH sets of adaptations:

**Low-Vision Accommodations (for ocular condition):**
- Size enlargement per functional vision assessment
- Contrast enhancement appropriate to condition
- Optimal positioning for visual field
- Appropriate lighting and glare management
- Assistive technology as prescribed (magnifiers, CCTV, screen magnification)
- Seating placement for best visual access

**CVI Accommodations (for brain-based processing):**
- Complexity reduction (clutter, arrays, competing elements)
- Latency allowance (wait time, processing time)
- Consistent visual language
- Explicit search instruction
- Fatigue management
- Phased complexity introduction

### Example: Math Worksheet (Mixed CVI + Nystagmus)

**Original:** Standard worksheet with 20 problems

**Adapted for BOTH conditions:**
- **Enlargement** (addressing nystagmus): Font size per low-vision assessment; typically 18-24pt
- **High contrast and matte finish** (low-vision): Black on white, non-glossy paper
- **Reduced problems per page** (CVI complexity): 3-4 problems maximum
- **Spacing and boxing** (CVI clutter): Each problem in clear box with whitespace
- **Extended time** (both): Allows for both processing time and physical eye movement challenges
- **Positioning** (both): Materials placed for optimal head position (nystagmus null point) AND in functional visual field
- **Masking option** (CVI): Strip available to reduce visible content

## When Profile Is Unclear

If the processing profile is uncertain:

### Step 1: Apply Universal CVI Adaptations
- Reduce clutter and complexity
- Increase spacing
- Add latency (wait time)
- Use consistent, predictable layouts
- Observe what helps

### Step 2: Test Hypotheses Systematically

| Observation | Hypothesis | Test |
|-------------|------------|------|
| Struggles to find items; overwhelmed by busy pages | Dorsal challenges | Reduce array size; add anchors; see if search improves |
| Confuses similar items; doesn't recognize familiar symbols | Ventral challenges | Add labels; increase consistency; see if recognition improves |
| Needs materials close; squints; avoids glare | Lower-level involvement | Enlarge; increase contrast; reduce glare; see if access improves |
| Fatigues quickly despite "good" vision | Higher-VFD | Reduce complexity; shorten tasks; see if endurance improves |

### Step 3: Change ONE Variable at a Time
- If you change multiple things, you cannot identify what helped
- Document each change and result

### Step 4: Share Observations
- Provide detailed observations to TVI and vision team
- Observations inform more targeted assessment
- Note: Do not diagnose; describe functional observations

## Multiple Profiles

Many students show characteristics of more than one profile. When profiles combine:

1. **Apply adaptations from ALL relevant categories** - Do not choose only one
2. **Prioritize based on primary challenge** - If adaptations conflict, address the most significant barrier first
3. **Document which supports help most** - This informs ongoing planning
4. **Expect complexity** - Mixed profiles require individualized approaches
5. **Collaborate with vision team** - Multiple profiles warrant team problem-solving
