name: cvi-adapt-content-phase1
description: Adapt classroom content for CVI Phase I (most severe functional impact) by isolating single targets, minimizing visual complexity, using preferred visual features to “turn vision on,” allowing latency, and pairing vision with touch/sound. Triggers: CVI Phase I, CVI Range 0-3, severe CVI, visual attention, clutter overwhelms, latency, attracted to light, needs one target at a time.

Use this skill when the student’s functional vision is most impacted and access depends on carefully controlled visual conditions.

## Procedure
1) **Reduce complexity to the minimum**
- One target at a time, plain background, remove decorative elements.

2) **Use “attention on-ramps”**
- If the student has a known preference (color/light/movement), use it briefly to gain attention, then fade.

3) **Design for latency**
- Build in wait time. Avoid rapid prompting or “look here, look there” sequences.

4) **Short, successful trials**
- Break work into tiny chunks with planned breaks.

5) **Pair with tactile/audio confirmation**
- Student should be allowed to confirm with hands/hearing; visual function may be inconsistent.

## Worked examples
### Example 1: Letter identification
- Convert a busy alphabet page into: one large letter per page on a plain mat; add optional tactile outline; teacher presents, waits, student confirms by touch.

### Example 2: Counting objects
- Replace tiny clipart arrays with 3–5 real objects or large simple shapes on a plain tray; present one set at a time; student counts with touch support.

## Edge cases
- If the student only responds to movement/light: use briefly, then reduce; avoid turning every task into a “light show.”
- If behaviors vary daily: keep the same simple format but adjust session length and environment.

## Do not do
- Do not present crowded multi-step worksheets.
- Do not assume “not looking” means “not understanding”—increase wait time and reduce competition.
