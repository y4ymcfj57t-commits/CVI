# Phase II complexity ladder (change one rung at a time)

Rung 1: Single target, plain background  
Rung 2: Two targets, plain background  
Rung 3: Small array (3–5), plain background  
Rung 4: Same array with light framing/boxes  
Rung 5: Same array with mild background detail  
Rung 6: Increase distance (near → mid)  
Rung 7: Add time pressure only after accuracy and endurance are stable
