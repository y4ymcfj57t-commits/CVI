description: Adapt classroom content for CVI Phase II by keeping materials highly organized, adding visual complexity one variable at a time, teaching visual search routines, and maintaining multisensory access supports. Triggers: CVI Phase II, CVI Range 4-7, moderate CVI, needs structured layout, learning visual search, crowding issues.
---

Use this skill when the student is building purposeful visual use but still needs systematic supports.

## Procedure
1) **Start simple, then add ONE complexity variable**
- Variables: background detail, distance, array size, number of steps visible, competing sensory input.

2) **Organize for predictable access**
- Consistent page layout, generous spacing, clear headings, stable iconography.

3) **Teach visual search explicitly**
- Provide anchors (start points, boxes, arrows).
- Teach scan routine (left-to-right; top-to-bottom; “look–locate–confirm”).

4) **Maintain multisensory supports**
- Pair visuals with verbal cues; allow touch confirmation; don’t remove supports just because vision is improving.

## Worked examples
### Example 1: Multi-problem math worksheet
- Keep the same problems.
- Present 3 problems at a time (masking strip).
- Add a consistent “problem box” with large number label and ample whitespace.

### Example 2: Science diagram labeling
- Use one diagram per page.
- Provide labels on separate cards to match (reduces crowding).
- Add a step list: “Find title → find arrows → match label.”

## Edge cases
- If student does well at near but not far: provide near copy of board content and reduce reliance on copying.
- If complexity increase causes regression: step back one rung on the ladder.

## Do not do
- Don’t add multiple complexity increases at once (e.g., smaller font + more items + busy background).
- Don’t assume the student will “pick up” search skills without explicit instruction.
