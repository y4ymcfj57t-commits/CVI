# Profile → Adaptations Matrix

## Lower-level / basic visual function (acuity/fields/glare)
- Increase size, improve contrast, reduce glare
- Present in best visual field when a preference is known
- Provide near copies and controlled lighting

## Dorsal-leaning (“where/how”: clutter, search, busy scenes)
- Reduce clutter/crowding; simplify arrays; fewer items visible at once
- Explicit scanning routines; anchors; consistent layout
- Reduce competing sensory input during visual tasks

## Ventral-leaning (“what”: recognition of faces/objects/symbols)
- Consistent presentation (stable icons/fonts)
- Pair visuals with labels/verbal cues; allow tactile confirmation
- Prefer real objects / consistent photos before abstract line drawings
- Teach feature-based recognition (shape/color/function)

## Higher visual function deficits (good acuity, functional struggle)
- Clean design: spacing, fewer simultaneous demands, stepwise displays
- Fatigue plan: breaks, reduced copy load, multimodal access

## Mixed CVI + ocular
- Combine low-vision supports (size/contrast/glare/fields) PLUS CVI supports (complexity control, latency, predictable layout)
