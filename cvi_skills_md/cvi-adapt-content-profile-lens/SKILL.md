name: cvi-adapt-content-profile-lens
description: Adapt classroom content for CVI by processing profile (dorsal/ventral/lower-level/higher-VFD/mixed), selecting targeted changes for clutter/search, recognition, size/contrast/fields, fatigue, and combining low-vision + CVI supports when needed. Triggers: dorsal stream, ventral stream, visual recognition, visual search, crowding, field loss, glare, higher visual function deficits, mixed CVI ocular.

Use this skill when you know (or strongly suspect) a CVI processing profile, even if the severity phase is unknown.

## Procedure
1) Identify the likely profile from reported difficulties.
2) Apply the matching adaptation set from the matrix in `references/profile-to-adaptations-matrix.md`.
3) Add micro-characteristics modifiers (field preference, latency, fatigue).
4) Produce: student-ready spec + teacher presentation script.

## Worked examples

### Example 1: Dorsal-leaning (search/clutter)
- Material: worksheet with many small items.
- Adapt: reduce array size, add boxes, mask extras, teach scan routine, reduce competing noise during visual tasks.

### Example 2: Ventral-leaning (recognition)
- Material: science symbols/icons and diagrams.
- Adapt: consistent icon set, explicit labels, use photos/real objects first, teach feature-based recognition.

## Edge cases
- Profile unclear: start with declutter + spacing + latency; then test dorsal vs ventral hypotheses by changing only one variable.
- Mixed CVI + ocular: add glare control, size/contrast, and field accommodations alongside CVI complexity controls.

## Do not do
- Don’t assume one profile explains everything—many students are mixed.
- Don’t create inconsistent visual languages across materials (new icons/fonts each time) if ventral challenges are present.
