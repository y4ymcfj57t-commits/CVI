# Output formats

## 1) Adaptation Plan (teacher-facing)
- Student profile summary (Phase, Profile, key micro-characteristics)
- “Zero-regret” changes (layout/spacing/declutter/latency)
- Targeted changes (Phase + Profile specific)
- Presentation script (how to show it; how long to wait; what to remove)
- Monitoring: what to watch for + how to iterate

## 2) Student-ready spec (so someone can rebuild the material)
- Page structure (items per page, margins, whitespace targets)
- Visual language (fonts/icons consistency, contrast, backgrounds)
- Array limits (max items visible at once)
- Supports (masking, anchors, headings, step labels)
- Alternate access (tactile/audio/verbal)

## 3) Fidelity checklist
- Complexity reduced?
- Only one new element introduced at a time?
- Field preference honored?
- Latency supported (wait time + fewer prompts)?
- Fatigue plan present (breaks, chunking)?
