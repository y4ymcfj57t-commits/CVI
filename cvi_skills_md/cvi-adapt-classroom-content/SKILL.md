description: Adapt classroom materials for a student with CVI by first identifying severity (CVI Range Phase I/II/III) and processing profile (dorsal/ventral/lower-level/higher-VFD/mixed), then applying targeted design changes (reduce complexity, honor field preference, add latency, manage fatigue). Triggers: CVI, cerebral visual impairment, cortical visual impairment, clutter/crowding, visual search, latency, field preference, dorsal stream, ventral stream.

This skill helps an agent adapt classroom content for a student with Cortical/Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI). CVI is brain-based visual processing dysfunction, so adaptations must match both (a) **severity** and (b) **type of visual processing difficulty**.

## Procedure

### 1) Intake (ask only what you need)
Collect the minimum info needed to adapt the content.

**Student access profile**
- CVI Range Phase (I / II / III) if known; otherwise ask for observable behaviors.
- Processing profile if known: dorsal-leaning, ventral-leaning, lower-level (acuity/fields), higher visual function deficits (good acuity but functional issues), or mixed CVI+ocular.
- Micro-characteristics: visual complexity sensitivity, field preference, latency, movement need, light sensitivity/attraction, distance viewing difficulty, fatigue/variability.

**Content context**
- Grade/subject and learning goal (do not reduce rigor).
- Content type: worksheet/handout, slide deck, textbook page, graphic organizer, diagram, assessment, board notes.
- Delivery: print, projected, digital (tablet/laptop), or mixed.
- Environment: quiet corner vs busy room; time constraints; whether support staff is present.

### 2) Decide which “lens” to apply
Apply both lenses:

**A) Severity lens**
- Phase I: “turn vision on” reliably with minimal complexity.
- Phase II: build purposeful visual use; introduce complexity gradually.
- Phase III: supports for real-world complexity, search, clutter, fatigue; teach compensations.

**B) Profile lens**
- Dorsal-leaning: search/clutter/motion/busy places; simplify arrays; explicit scanning.
- Ventral-leaning: recognition (faces/objects/symbols); increase consistency; pair labels; use real objects/photos first.
- Lower-level: size/contrast/fields/glare.
- Higher-VFD: clean design despite “good acuity”; manage fatigue; reduce simultaneous demands.
- Mixed CVI+ocular: combine low-vision supports + CVI supports.

### 3) Generate an Adaptation Plan (not just a modified file)
Create a plan with three tiers:

**Tier 1: Zero-regret changes** (almost always help)
- Reduce clutter/crowding; increase spacing; remove non-essential decoration.
- One direction at a time; add wait time (latency).
- Provide predictable layout and consistent visual language.

**Tier 2: Targeted changes** (based on Phase/Profile)
- Phase I: isolate single targets; high-contrast on plain background; short bursts; use preferred color/light/movement strategically.
- Dorsal: reduce array size; add visual anchors; teach scan routine.
- Ventral: consistent icons/fonts; pair with labels; prefer photos/real objects.

**Tier 3: Compensations + instruction**
- Teach strategies (“look–locate–confirm”).
- Add multimodal access: tactile, audio, verbal mediation, checklists.

### 4) Produce the outputs
Choose the right artifacts:
- **Student-ready version** (print/digital)
- **Teacher-facing instructions** (how to present, how long to wait, what to remove)
- **Fidelity checklist** (did we keep complexity low, honor field preference, etc.)

Use templates in `references/adaptation-output-formats.md`.

### 5) Validate and iterate
- Ask for quick feedback: “What part still feels visually hard?”
- Iterate by changing only ONE variable at a time (spacing, contrast, array size, background, distance).

## Worked examples

### Example 1: Phase I math “count the objects” worksheet
**Input**
- Student: Phase I; strong sensitivity to clutter; latency; attracted to bright color.
- Material: crowded worksheet with 12 problems, each with small clipart objects.

**Agent actions**
1. Keep the learning goal: counting and matching numerals.
2. Rebuild as “one target at a time”:
   - One problem per page (or cover strip).
   - Use a single high-contrast target set on plain background.
3. Use preferred color as an attention “on-ramp” (e.g., bright outline) but remove extra decoration.
4. Provide teacher script: present, pause, wait; short session; break.

**Output**
- Student version: 1–2 problems/page, large simple shapes, plain background.
- Teacher instructions: wait time, reduce competing sound, allow touch confirmation.

### Example 2: Phase III reading comprehension with dorsal-leaning features
**Input**
- Student: Phase III; struggles in clutter; slow search; fatigues after 10 minutes.
- Material: dense passage + multiple-choice on one page with sidebars.

**Agent actions**
1. Keep rigor: same passage and questions.
2. Reformat:
   - Remove sidebars; increase line spacing; chunk paragraphs.
   - Put questions on separate pages; reduce simultaneous choices visible.
3. Add scan supports:
   - Highlight question stem only (not whole page).
   - Add a “find it” routine: locate paragraph number → locate sentence.

**Output**
- Student version: clean passage, spaced, questions separated.
- Teacher instructions: quiet environment for visual tasks, short blocks, breaks.

## Edge cases and how to handle
- **Unknown Phase/Profile:** default to “reduce complexity + add latency + consistent layout,” then ask what improved.
- **Student has ‘good acuity’ but still struggles:** treat as higher visual function deficits—clean design and fatigue supports.
- **Mixed ocular + CVI:** apply both size/contrast/glare controls and CVI complexity/latency controls.
- **Teacher insists on original format:** provide a compromise (masking strip, fewer items visible, digital zoom, separate question pages).

## Do not do / safety boundaries
- Do not “diagnose” CVI; only adapt based on documented plan/observed behaviors.
- Do not lower academic expectations; preserve learning goal and content whenever possible.
- Do not overload with simultaneous accommodations; change one variable at a time to learn what works.
- If student distress increases, stop and reduce sensory load; recommend team review (TVI/OT/SLP).
