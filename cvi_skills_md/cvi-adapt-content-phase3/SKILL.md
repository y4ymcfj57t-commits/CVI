description: Adapt classroom content for CVI Phase III by reducing clutter and crowding, supporting visual search in complex materials, providing clean copies and digital zoom/spacing, and teaching compensatory routines and self-advocacy. Triggers: CVI Phase III, CVI Range 8-10, looks typical but struggles, clutter, busy environments, fatigue, visual search.

Use this skill when the student can use vision but struggles with real-world complexity, search, noise/motion, and fatigue.

## Procedure
1) **Optimize classroom materials for low clutter**
- Clean copies, fewer simultaneous elements, generous whitespace, consistent formatting.

2) **Support search-heavy tasks**
- Separate questions from passages, reduce on-page competition, add headings/anchors, highlight only what matters.

3) **Leverage digital affordances**
- Provide versions that allow zoom, reflow, spacing, and masking.
- Offer “board note” copies instead of requiring extensive copying.

4) **Teach compensations**
- Stepwise visual routines (“look–locate–confirm”).
- Checklists and verbal mediation for multi-step tasks.
- Self-advocacy scripts: “I need less clutter / more time / a clean copy.”

5) **Plan for fatigue**
- Chunk work; planned breaks; avoid putting the most visual tasks at the end of long days when possible.

## Worked examples
### Example 1: Social studies textbook page
- Convert to: one column, larger line spacing, remove sidebars, keep headings; provide audio support; questions on separate page.

### Example 2: Timed math quiz (dorsal-like challenges)
- Keep same items and timing rules if required, but:
  - Provide masking strip,
  - Use boxed problems with whitespace,
  - Allow short micro-breaks if permitted.

## Edge cases
- If the student struggles mainly in cafeterias/assemblies: prioritize portable supports (simple visual schedule, verbal preview, quieter seating) even if paper materials are fine.
- If supports are being faded: remind team that demands rise with grade level; keep accommodations aligned to tasks, not appearance.

## Do not do
- Don’t withdraw supports solely because acuity looks good.
- Don’t add visual “help” that increases clutter (excess highlighting, too many icons).
