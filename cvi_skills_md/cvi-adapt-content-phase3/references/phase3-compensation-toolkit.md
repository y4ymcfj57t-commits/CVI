# Phase III compensation toolkit

- Clean copy + declutter rule
- Separate simultaneous demands (passage vs questions)
- Visual anchors: headings, boxes, numbering, consistent placement
- Masking options: strip, digital crop, one-question view
- Routine: look → locate → confirm → respond
- Self-advocacy scripts (short and repeatable)
