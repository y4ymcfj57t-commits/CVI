# Phase I Adaptations

Use this reference when adapting content for students with CVI Phase I (CVI Range 0-3, most severe functional impact). Visual access depends on carefully controlled conditions.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Reduce complexity to minimum** | One target at a time; plain background; remove all decorative elements |
| **Use attention on-ramps** | If student has known preference (color/light/movement), use briefly to gain attention, then fade |
| **Design for latency** | Build in wait time (5-10+ seconds); avoid rapid prompting or "look here, look there" sequences |
| **Short, successful trials** | Break work into tiny chunks; plan breaks; sessions often 5-10 minutes maximum |
| **Pair with tactile/audio** | Allow confirmation with hands/hearing; visual function may be inconsistent |

## Adaptation Checklist

Before finalizing Phase I materials, verify:

- [ ] Only ONE target visible at a time
- [ ] Background is plain (solid color, no patterns or images)
- [ ] ALL decorative elements removed
- [ ] High contrast between target and background
- [ ] Preferred color/light used only as initial attention cue (not constant)
- [ ] Teacher script includes explicit wait time (minimum 5-10 seconds)
- [ ] Session length is appropriate (often 5-10 minutes maximum)
- [ ] Touch confirmation is permitted
- [ ] Audio/verbal cues available as backup
- [ ] Learning goal is preserved despite format changes

## Worked Examples

### Letter Identification

**Original:** Busy alphabet page with 26 letters, illustrations, decorative border

**Adapted version:**
- One large letter per page OR on plain mat
- Plain white or student's preferred-color background
- Optional tactile outline for touch confirmation
- No other visual elements on page

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Present letter mat in student's functional field
2. Say letter name once, then wait silently (10+ seconds)
3. Allow student to approach at own pace
4. Accept verbal OR touch response
5. Session limit: 3-5 letters maximum, then break

### Counting Objects

**Original:** Worksheet with 10 problems, each showing 8-15 tiny clipart objects in rows

**Adapted version:**
- Use 3-5 REAL objects OR large simple shapes on plain tray
- Present one set at a time (cover or remove other sets)
- Objects should be high contrast against tray surface

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Present single set of objects on plain surface
2. Say "How many?" and wait (10+ seconds)
3. Allow student to touch objects while counting
4. Acknowledge response before presenting next set
5. Session limit: 2-3 sets, then break

### Picture Matching

**Original:** 6x6 grid of small pictures to match pairs

**Adapted version:**
- Present only 2-3 large pictures on plain surface
- Present match candidate separately (not in the array)
- Student indicates match verbally or by touch

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Lay out 2-3 pictures with generous space between them
2. Present one card separately: "Which one matches?"
3. Allow extended visual scanning time (10+ seconds minimum)
4. Expand to 4 options ONLY if consistently successful at 3
5. Do not rush progression

### Choice-Making

**Original:** Choice board with 9 small icons

**Adapted version:**
- Maximum 2-3 choices at a time
- Each choice on separate card or in separate location
- High contrast, simple images or objects
- Remove all choices not currently relevant

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Present 2 choices with space between
2. Name each choice while indicating it
3. Wait for visual attention or gesture
4. Accept any consistent response (eye gaze, reach, vocalization)

## What NOT to Do

| Mistake | Why It Is Problematic | Correction |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| Presenting multiple targets | Overwhelms limited visual processing capacity | Mask all but one target |
| Using light/movement constantly | Creates dependency rather than purposeful vision | Use briefly to gain attention, then remove |
| Interpreting "not looking" as "not understanding" | Latency may cause delayed response; vision may be inconsistent | Increase wait time; reduce visual competition |
| Rushing through prompts | Does not allow visual system time to engage | Pause 5-10+ seconds between prompts |
| Using busy reward stickers/stamps | Adds visual noise during successful moment | Use verbal praise or simple touch-based reward |
| Removing supports on "good days" | Creates inconsistency; student cannot predict access | Maintain simple format; adjust session length instead |

## Managing Variability

Visual function in Phase I often varies significantly based on:
- Time of day (often better after rest)
- Fatigue level (vision may "turn off" when tired)
- Illness or stress
- Environmental factors (lighting, noise, activity level)
- Positioning and physical state

**Strategy:** Maintain the SAME simple format across all sessions, but adjust:
- Session length based on observed engagement
- Number of trials based on daily capacity
- Environment based on student state (quieter location if fatigued)
- Time of day for visual tasks (when possible, schedule during optimal times)

## Responding to Daily Variation

| Observation | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| Student engages quickly, responds consistently | May extend session slightly; still take breaks |
| Student slow to engage but eventually responds | Reduce number of trials; maintain wait time |
| Student not engaging at all | Shorten session significantly; try again later; check environment |
| Student shows distress | Stop immediately; do not push; consult team |

## Transition Indicators

Consider advancing toward Phase II strategies when student CONSISTENTLY:
- Responds to single targets without extensive latency
- Begins spontaneously scanning for familiar items
- Shows curiosity about materials rather than avoidance
- Tolerates slightly busier backgrounds without regression
- Demonstrates these behaviors across multiple sessions and environments

**Do NOT advance if:**
- Behaviors are inconsistent or only present in optimal conditions
- Student still requires maximum wait time regularly
- Any increase in complexity causes immediate regression
- Team has not observed and agreed on readiness

## Environment Setup for Phase I

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Lighting | Consistent, indirect; avoid glare; may need dimmer or brighter based on student |
| Sound | Minimize competing auditory input during visual tasks |
| Movement | Reduce visual motion in environment; position away from high-traffic areas |
| Positioning | Student in comfortable, supported position; materials in functional field |
| Timing | Schedule visual tasks when student is rested and alert |
| Duration | Plan for very short sessions with breaks built in |
