# Phase II Adaptations

Use this reference when adapting content for students with CVI Phase II (CVI Range 4-7, moderate functional impact). Student is building purposeful visual use but still requires systematic supports.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Start simple, add ONE complexity variable** | Variables include: background detail, distance, array size, number of steps visible, competing sensory input |
| **Organize for predictable access** | Consistent page layout; generous spacing; clear headings; stable iconography across materials |
| **Teach visual search explicitly** | Provide anchors (start points, boxes, arrows); teach scan routines (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) |
| **Maintain multisensory supports** | Pair visuals with verbal cues; allow touch confirmation; do not remove supports just because vision is improving |

## Adaptation Checklist

Before finalizing Phase II materials, verify:

- [ ] Starting point is simplified (not jumping to full complexity)
- [ ] Only ONE complexity variable increased from previous level
- [ ] Layout is consistent across all pages/materials
- [ ] Clear visual anchors mark starting points
- [ ] Headings are distinct and in predictable locations
- [ ] Search routine is provided (written steps or verbal script)
- [ ] Verbal and tactile supports remain available
- [ ] Masking option is provided for larger arrays
- [ ] Learning goal is preserved despite format changes

## Complexity Ladder

Increase complexity ONE step at a time. If any increase causes regression, return to previous level.

| Level | Background | Array Size | Distance | Competing Input |
|-------|------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Plain solid color | 1-3 items | Near only | Quiet, minimal distractions |
| 2 | Simple pattern or texture | 4-6 items | Near | Low background noise |
| 3 | Moderate detail | 7-10 items | Near + brief far glances | Moderate activity |
| 4 | Naturalistic/busy | 10+ items | Far copying required | Typical classroom |

**Rule:** Master current level across multiple sessions before advancing. One regression means return to previous level and maintain longer.

## Worked Examples

### Multi-Problem Math Worksheet

**Original:** 20 problems on one page, mixed formats, decorative border

**Adapted version:**
- Keep all 20 problems (preserve academic rigor)
- Present 3 problems at a time using masking strip
- Each problem in consistent "problem box" format:
  - Large problem number as visual anchor (e.g., circled or boxed)
  - Ample whitespace around problem
  - Answer line in consistent position
- Student unmasks next set after completing current set

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Provide masking strip positioned to show first 3 problems
2. Student completes visible problems
3. Student moves strip to reveal next 3
4. Verbal prompt available: "Find the problem number, read the problem, write your answer"
5. Fade verbal prompts as student demonstrates independence

### Science Diagram Labeling

**Original:** Complex diagram with 12 labels connected by crossing lines on cluttered page

**Adapted version:**
- One diagram per page (remove surrounding content)
- Labels provided on separate cards (reduces on-page visual competition)
- Lines simplified (no crossing if possible)
- Step list provided for the task

**Step list for student:**
1. Find the title of the diagram
2. Find the arrows or lines pointing to parts
3. Pick up one label card
4. Find where it matches on the diagram
5. Place or write the label
6. Repeat for each label

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Present diagram and label cards
2. Guide student through step list initially (verbal prompts)
3. Fade prompts as student internalizes the routine
4. If student struggles, reduce number of labels to match at one time

### Reading Passage with Questions

**Original:** Passage and 5 questions on same page, dense text, small font

**Adapted version:**
- Passage on page 1 with numbered paragraphs
- Increased line spacing (1.5x minimum)
- Questions on page 2 (or one question per page if needed)
- "Find it" routine provided

**"Find it" routine for student:**
1. Read the question
2. Note which paragraph the question asks about (if indicated)
3. Turn to passage
4. Find that paragraph number
5. Read the paragraph
6. Return to question and answer

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Teach the flip routine explicitly before independent practice
2. Allow finger tracking on text
3. Provide verbal prompts initially, then fade
4. If student loses place frequently, add colored tabs to mark pages

### Multiple Choice Assessment

**Original:** 30 questions with 4 choices each, dense layout, both columns used

**Adapted version:**
- Single column layout
- 4-5 questions per page with clear separation
- Each question in a box with the question number as anchor
- Answer choices labeled A, B, C, D with consistent indentation
- Answer bubbles or lines in consistent position

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Provide masking strip if student prefers
2. Teach routine: "Read number, read question, read ALL choices, then answer"
3. Allow extended time
4. Monitor for fatigue; offer breaks between pages

## Teaching Visual Search

Students in Phase II often need explicit instruction in how to search visually. Do not assume these skills will develop without teaching.

### "Look-Locate-Confirm" Routine

Teach this three-step routine for any search task:

1. **Look** - Begin systematic scan (left to right, top to bottom)
2. **Locate** - Find the target or anchor point
3. **Confirm** - Verify correct location before acting

### Anchor Systems

| Material Type | Anchor Strategy |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Worksheets | Box or circle the starting point; number problems clearly |
| Textbooks | Use sticky tabs; highlight headings only (not full text) |
| Diagrams | Add a "start here" arrow; number steps |
| Schedules | Use consistent symbols; bold current item |

### Scan Pattern Training

If student scans randomly or inefficiently:
1. Use finger or pointer to model left-to-right scanning
2. Practice on simple arrays before complex materials
3. Provide verbal narration: "Start at the top left, move across, drop down, move across"
4. Gradually fade physical and verbal supports

## What NOT to Do

| Mistake | Why It Is Problematic | Correction |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| Adding multiple complexity increases at once | Cannot identify what caused difficulty | Change ONE variable at a time |
| Assuming search skills are intuitive | Visual search requires explicit instruction for many students with CVI | Teach scan routines explicitly |
| Removing supports when vision "looks better" | Performance varies; premature removal causes regression | Fade gradually; keep backup available |
| Using inconsistent layouts across materials | Each new format requires new learning | Standardize layouts across subjects |
| Jumping from near success to far demands | Distance is a separate skill requiring separate practice | Build distance tolerance gradually |

## Near vs. Far Considerations

Students in Phase II often succeed with near work before far work.

**Near work setup:**
- Slant board or bookstand positions materials optimally
- Adequate lighting on work surface (check for glare)
- Materials in student's functional field
- Reduce need to shift gaze between locations

**For far content (board, projection):**
- Provide personal copy at near (do not require copying from board)
- If far viewing is required, enlarge projected content
- Reduce complexity of projected materials
- Allow student to move closer if needed

**Building far viewing:**
- Practice with familiar content at increasing distances
- Start with brief far glances, return to near
- Gradually increase duration and complexity of far tasks
- Do not combine new content with new distance demands

## Transition Indicators

Consider advancing toward Phase III strategies when student CONSISTENTLY:
- Handles 8-10 item arrays with anchor supports
- Applies search routines with minimal prompting
- Tolerates moderate background complexity
- Works successfully at both near and far (with appropriate supports)
- Shows consistent performance across multiple sessions

**Continue Phase II supports if:**
- Performance varies significantly day to day
- New environments or materials cause regression
- Student relies heavily on verbal prompts for search
- Fatigue causes noticeable decline within sessions
- Any regression when complexity increases
