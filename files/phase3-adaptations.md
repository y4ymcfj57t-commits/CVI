# Phase III Adaptations

Use this reference when adapting content for students with CVI Phase III (CVI Range 8-10). Student can use vision functionally but struggles with real-world complexity, visual search in cluttered environments, noise/motion, and fatigue.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Optimize for low clutter** | Clean copies; fewer simultaneous elements; generous whitespace; consistent formatting |
| **Support search-heavy tasks** | Separate questions from passages; reduce on-page competition; add headings/anchors; highlight only what matters |
| **Leverage digital affordances** | Provide versions with zoom, reflow, spacing, masking options; board-note copies instead of copying |
| **Teach compensations** | Stepwise visual routines; checklists; verbal mediation; self-advocacy scripts |
| **Plan for fatigue** | Chunk work; planned breaks; avoid scheduling hardest visual tasks at end of day |

## Adaptation Checklist

Before finalizing Phase III materials, verify:

- [ ] Clean copy provided (extraneous elements removed)
- [ ] Layout is uncluttered with generous whitespace
- [ ] Search-heavy content restructured (questions separate from source text)
- [ ] Only essential highlighting used (not adding visual noise)
- [ ] Digital version available with zoom/reflow/spacing options
- [ ] Compensation strategy taught or checklist provided
- [ ] Fatigue management plan in place (session length, breaks, scheduling)
- [ ] Self-advocacy language taught for requesting supports
- [ ] Learning goal preserved despite format changes

## Worked Examples

### Social Studies Textbook Page

**Original:** Two-column layout with main text, sidebar "Did You Know?" boxes, timeline graphic, images with captions, pull quotes, decorative header

**Adapted version:**
- Reformat to single column
- Main text only (sidebars converted to optional supplemental document)
- Line spacing increased to 1.5x
- Images moved to separate pages with captions directly below
- Headings clear, consistent, and larger than body text
- Pull quotes and decorative elements removed
- Questions on separate page from passage

**Additional supports:**
- Audio version available as backup for high-fatigue days
- Digital version with adjustable text size

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Student uses clean copy for primary reading
2. Supplemental content (sidebars) available if student chooses
3. Audio backup available for fatigue management
4. Reading blocks of 15-20 minutes with movement break between
5. Visual tasks scheduled earlier in day when possible

### Timed Math Assessment

**Original:** 30 problems on two pages, 20 minutes, dense layout, small font

**Adapted version (maintaining assessment validity):**
- Same items and time limit (if standardized test)
- Reformatted with:
  - Masking strip provided
  - Problems boxed with whitespace between
  - Problems grouped (5-6 per section with visual separator)
  - Larger font if permitted
  - Single column layout

**If modifications (not just accommodations) are permitted:**
- Extended time
- Reduced number of problems while sampling same skills
- Breaks between sections

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Provide all accommodations allowed by testing guidelines
2. Document which supports were used
3. If student shows significant fatigue, note in testing report
4. Request morning testing administration when possible

### Research Project with Multiple Sources

**Original:** Student reads 4 articles, takes notes, synthesizes into essay - all in one class period

**Adapted version:**
- Reformat all articles (clean copies, single column, increased spacing)
- Break project into explicit phases across multiple sessions:
  - Session 1: Read and annotate Article 1
  - Session 2: Read and annotate Article 2
  - Session 3: Read and annotate Articles 3-4
  - Session 4: Review notes and create outline
  - Session 5: Draft essay
- Provide checklist for each phase
- Use digital note-taking to reduce visual fatigue of handwriting

**Source-by-source routine:**
1. Open Article 1 only
2. Read and take notes
3. Close Article 1 before opening Article 2
4. Never have all sources visible simultaneously
5. Synthesize from notes, not from re-reading all sources at once

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Explicitly assign phases to different sessions
2. Verbal check-in at each phase to prevent overwhelm
3. Allow audio recording of ideas as alternative to written notes
4. Provide essay template with section headers

### Novel Study with Discussion Questions

**Original:** Read chapter at home, answer 10 questions in class using the book

**Adapted version:**
- Clean copy of chapter provided (or audiobook option)
- Questions provided in advance (student can annotate while reading)
- Questions reformatted: one per page, with line numbers referencing passage
- "Find it" routine:
  1. Read question
  2. Note the line numbers or page reference
  3. Turn to that location
  4. Re-read relevant section
  5. Return to question and answer

**Teacher instructions:**
1. Allow audio version of novel if preferred
2. Questions provided day before discussion (student annotates during reading)
3. Discussion in smaller group or with verbal rather than written response option
4. If student has not finished reading, prioritize discussion participation over written questions

## Compensation Strategies

### "Look-Locate-Confirm" Routine

For any visual search task:
1. **Look** - Begin systematic scan (left to right, top to bottom)
2. **Locate** - Find the target area or anchor point
3. **Confirm** - Verify correct location before taking action

### Verbal Mediation

Student talks through visual tasks (aloud or internally):
- "I'm looking for the date... scanning the top of the page... found it in the header"
- "I need to find paragraph 3... counting down... 1, 2, 3... here it is"

**Benefits:** Reduces cognitive load; creates verbal backup for visual processing; helps maintain focus

### Checklists for Multi-Step Tasks

Provide written checklists for any task with multiple visual components:
- [ ] Step 1: Find the title
- [ ] Step 2: Read the directions
- [ ] Step 3: Locate the first question
- [ ] Step 4: Complete and check before moving on

### Self-Advocacy Scripts

Teach student to request supports appropriately:
- "I need a cleaner copy of this page."
- "Can I have the questions on a separate page from the passage?"
- "I need a short break before the next visual task."
- "The lighting/glare is making it hard for me to see."
- "I work better with a digital copy I can zoom."
- "I need to sit closer to see the board."

## Digital Affordances

| Need | Digital Solution |
|------|------------------|
| Reduce clutter | Reader mode in browser; reflow text; remove ads and sidebars |
| Adjust size | Pinch zoom; font size settings; browser zoom |
| Adjust spacing | Line height settings; margin controls; text reflow |
| Reduce glare | Dark mode; blue light filter; matte screen protector |
| Mask content | Screen overlay apps; line guide apps; reduced window size |
| Audio backup | Text-to-speech; screen reader; audiobook versions |
| Reduce copying | Provide digital notes; shared documents; photo of board |

**Teach student to use these independently** - goal is self-management of accommodations.

## Fatigue Management

### Warning Signs of Visual Fatigue
- Slower response time than usual on familiar tasks
- Increased errors
- Avoidance behaviors or task refusal
- Physical signs: rubbing eyes, head down, squinting, restlessness
- Complaints of headache or eye strain
- Regression to behaviors seen at lower phases

### Fatigue Prevention Strategies
- Front-load visual tasks earlier in the day
- Chunk visual work into 15-20 minute blocks
- Alternate visual and non-visual tasks
- Build in planned breaks (not as punishment - as management)
- Reduce visual homework on days with high visual demand at school
- Provide audio alternatives when content allows

### Scheduling Considerations
- Avoid scheduling hardest visual tasks after lunch or at end of day
- For standardized testing, request morning administration
- Build recovery time after high-demand visual activities
- Coordinate with other teachers to avoid stacking visual demands
- Consider weekly rhythm (not all visual-heavy assessments same day)

## When Supports Appear Unnecessary

Students in Phase III often appear visually competent. This creates risk of inappropriate support removal.

**Remember:**
- Visual demands increase with each grade level
- Fatigue is cumulative and may not show until later in day or week
- Performance in controlled settings may not transfer to complex environments
- Accommodations enable access - they do not provide unfair advantage
- "Looks fine" is not an assessment of visual function

**Document regularly:**
- How student performs WITH supports in place
- What happens when supports are removed (even briefly)
- Fatigue patterns over time (time of day, day of week, time of year)
- Environmental factors affecting performance
- Academic performance trends

## What NOT to Do

| Mistake | Why It Is Problematic | Correction |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| Withdrawing supports because acuity tests normal | Phase III students struggle despite good acuity - that is the defining characteristic | Maintain supports based on functional performance |
| Adding visual "help" that increases clutter | Excess highlighting, stickers, icons, or decorations add visual noise | Use minimal, targeted visual supports only |
| Requiring extensive board copying | Copying from far to near is extremely demanding | Provide notes; allow photos of board |
| Scheduling visual tasks at end of day | Fatigue accumulates; end-of-day visual performance is often worst | Front-load visual demands |
| Assuming student will "grow out of it" | CVI is a brain-based condition; demands increase with grade level | Plan for ongoing support needs |
| Fading supports without data | May cause unnecessary regression | Track performance before and after any changes |

## Transition to Independence

Goal: Student self-manages accommodations and advocates for needs without adult initiation.

**Progression:**
1. Adult identifies need and provides support
2. Adult teaches student to recognize when support is needed
3. Student implements supports with adult reminder
4. Student implements supports independently
5. Student requests accommodations in new situations
6. Student explains needs to unfamiliar adults (new teachers, testing proctors)

**Maintain in IEP/504:**
- Keep accommodations documented even as student becomes independent
- Student may need adult backup in unfamiliar or high-stakes situations
- Documentation protects access rights
